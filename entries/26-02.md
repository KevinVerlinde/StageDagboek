# Journal entry for 26-02-2018

### Story

Today our internship mentor is not present on the campus but he's asked us to finish setting up the printers and configure the firewall

### IT Activities

- Install printers/drivers on the pc's
- Configure the pfsense

### Difficulties

- More last minute changes to how they want the printers setup
- We accidentally deleted everything off of one of the printers, got it all back though
