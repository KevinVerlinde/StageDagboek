# Journal entry for 08-05-2018

### Story

The end of that short week, busy but not too horrible

### IT Activities

- Register PC's in the FOG
- Image A111

### Difficulties

- Multicast was going to take forever so we opted for single unicasts at a time.
- Unicasts weren't all done when it was time to go home so we started the remaining ones and left it.
- We knew partitioning might get awkward so Michael had to do that later on, we wouldn't be back for a while.
