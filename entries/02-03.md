### Story

I woke up far too late (slept through all 4 of my alarms), thank f*** my sister was home to wake me up and drive me to the campus, so I was only about 15 minutes late.  
We started the day at the Ledebaan Campus, installing/configuring more printers on the pc's. Pretty much finishing off everything.  
Then we went to the 'Voorstad campus' to do even more printers and to finally finish off the firewall here.
