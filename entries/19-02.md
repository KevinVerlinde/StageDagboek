# Journal entry for 19-02-2018

### Story

This was the first day, we arrived 5 minutes late due to NMBS/SNCB delays.
We then asked the staff at the reception where we should wait, having announced ourselves as interns for Mr. Poppe.
They directed us to the teachers lounge, we waited there a further 25 minutes until the classes had started and decided to see if we were able to find the IT room we had been in only once before.
This was indeed the place we needed to be. The confusion at the reception was made clear to us later that day when the same confusion happened again.
There are 2 staff members with last name 'Poppe' at that particular school.

### IT Activities

- Make an inventory of all the firewall rules.
- Do some minor 'helpdesk level stuff' when asked to do so by the internship mentor.

### Difficulties

- Teamviewer no longer connecting to the server.
- RDP not working to the server from the windows laptops, luckily the linux laptop was able to rdp into the server.
