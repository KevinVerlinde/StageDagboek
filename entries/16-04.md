# Journal entry for 16-04-2018

### Story

First day back after 2 weeks of glorious holidays. We were asked to be at 'ledebaan'

### IT Activities

- Set up an ICT team (teams.microsoft)
- Listen to an explanation about Konica Minolta copiers
- Finish physical FOG install
- Reimplement the firewall rules that were lost at ledebaan
- Fix issues with site to site VPN

### Difficulties

- FOG install is being done on the wrong campus so interface allocations are tricky
