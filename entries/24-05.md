# Journal entry for 24-05-2018

### Story

Second to last day of the entire internship, we had to give our presentation today

### IT Activities

- Resolve RDP issue (CredSSP)
- Setup sharepoint sync on a number of laptops
- Meeting with Pieter and presentation

### Difficulties

- Some sharepoint rights issues, but found a workaround by opening the direct folder link instead of the entire share
