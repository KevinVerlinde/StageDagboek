# Journal entry for 22-02-2018

### Story

For today we were asked to be at the other campus to deal with certain situations there.

### IT Activities

- Resolve issues with the DC replication/sync
- Gather information on the printer/copiers we'll have to install later on

### Difficulties

- There was a lot of information to take to us (for the printers)
- The link/vpn between the DC's isn't working yet
