# Journal entry for 01-03-2018

### Story

Today was expected to be some more firewall and a fair bit of printer install/configuring

### IT Activities

- Sort out issues with the firewall
- Install/configure correct drivers (from the server) on all required/accesible devices

### Difficulties

- Firewall was working okay, the needed site to site vpn is dependant on the change in firewall at a different location, that's planned for tomorrow
- Minor issues with an incorrect driver and mainly a lot of domain/password difficulties
