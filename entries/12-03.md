### Story

Today we were 'on loan' to a different IT person within Scholengroep Dender.
We went to several elementary schools to install printers (konica minolta) but without a domain/printserver

### IT Activities

- Assist Konical Minolta technician if needed
- Install printer/driver on as many pc's as possible

### Difficulties

- I was a bit sick, so that was no fun
