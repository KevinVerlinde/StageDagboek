# Journal entry for 23-02-2018

### Story

The last day of the first week, so far it's been a fun experience, but quite tiring

### IT Activities

- Transfer userdata from the old to the new printers
- Work on the PFSense for the second site

### Difficulties

- Remembering the brief explanation we were given about the printers
- Finding correct hardware for the PFSense
- The firewall went down, shutting down the entire network with it. Turned out to be a busted PSU
