# Journal entry for 27-02-2018

### Story

The first part of the day we spent at yet another new campus: 'De Handelschool'. And for the afternoon we went back to the ledebaan campus


### IT Activities

- Basic setup of printers (network settings)
- Copy over printer data (users/addresses)
- Setup printers on pc's
- Attach RJ45 jacks to open cables
- Test RJ45 plugs

- Copy over even more data
- Help the Konica Minolta technicians where needed

### Difficulties

- Messed up a RJ45 jack (first time doing that so no big deal)
- Not enough time to get everything done in the allotted time (people have different schedules)
