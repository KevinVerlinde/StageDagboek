# Journal entry for 06-03-2018

### Story

The first couple hours we spent at the 'suburb' campus and afterwards we went to the ledebaan campus for more printers

### IT Activities

- Look into firewall/vpn/replication
- Figure out how the 'RICOH' printers work and place them (still in the boxes) in the correct rooms

### Difficulties

- Replication is still unsuccesfull
- Not all rooms were as easy to get the printer placed
