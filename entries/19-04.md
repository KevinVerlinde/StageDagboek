# Journal entry for 19-04-2018

### Story

Today we are going to install computers and hopefully image them from a new FOG server we're building at Voorstad

### IT Activities

- Install/place PC's at the electricians side of the campus
- Physical FOG installation

### Difficulties

- FOG keeps giving us a TFTP time-out, and none of us have any idea what the specific cause is. Not even our 'mentor'.
