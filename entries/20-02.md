# Journal entry for 20-02-2018

### Story

This was the second day, we made sure to be on time today.
We headed straight into the IT-room as instructed yesterday.

### IT Activities

- Some more minor helpdesk stuff when needed
- 'during lunch': take out the firewall and replace it with a PFSense firewall
- Setup the correct rules and forwarding, ...

### Difficulties

- Not being able to help people with small stuff since we're not familiar with all the systems and what we're allowed to do.
- Rules were taking a while to add, until Dirk mentioned that creating the forwarding would generate the rule automatically.
- Setting up a site to site connection between both campusses's DC's turned out to be a lot harder than we had anticipated, due to them using different firewall systems and us not having access to the settings of the other campus.
