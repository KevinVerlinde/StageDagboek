# Journal entry for 22-03-2018

### Story

Pim is sick today, so he's staying at home. That made the trip to the internship a little lonelier, but that's fine.

### IT Activities

- Power on all RICOH printers in Voorstad, help out the technician where needed
- Configure WPAD on the new DC (that's not in use yet)

### Difficulties

- Didn't know everything about WPAD yet, but google is our friend
